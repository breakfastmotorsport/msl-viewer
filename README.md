# MSL Viewer

A minimalistic approach to datalog visualization.

This application tries to provide an easy way of getting an overview of different engine variables and their variation with time.

![demo](demo/demo.png)

Simply load an MSL file generated by your engine management and tuning software (such as TunerStudio) and select the records you'd like to display as line graphs.

## Technical Aspects

This application does not use external resources. It uses D3.js as a basis for the interactive data visualization.

At the moment this application is considered a (working) prototype. There is still some testing and tidying to do.
